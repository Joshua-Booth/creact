# Form Inputs

Components for capturing user input. Use this decision tree to pick the right one:

- Need multi-line text? &rarr; **Textarea**
- Need an OTP / verification code? &rarr; **InputOTP**
- Need icons or addons around an input? &rarr; **InputGroup**
- Need to select from a list?
  - Need search / autocomplete? &rarr; **Combobox**
  - Need custom styling? &rarr; **Select**
  - Need maximum browser compatibility? &rarr; **NativeSelect**
- Basic single-line text? &rarr; **Input**

## Choosing a Component

| Component | Type | Searchable | Multi-select |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Input](?path=/docs/ui-input--docs) | Text | N/A | N/A |
| [InputGroup](?path=/docs/ui-inputgroup--docs) | Text + addons | N/A | N/A |
| [InputOTP](?path=/docs/ui-inputotp--docs) | OTP code | N/A | N/A |
| [Textarea](?path=/docs/ui-textarea--docs) | Multi-line | N/A | N/A |
| [Select](?path=/docs/ui-select--docs) | Dropdown | No | No |
| [NativeSelect](?path=/docs/ui-nativeselect--docs) | Native dropdown | No (browser) | No |
| [Combobox](?path=/docs/ui-combobox--docs) | Autocomplete | Yes | Yes |

## Input

A standard single-line text field for emails, names, search queries, and other short-form text.

<Canvas of={InputStories.Default} />

## InputGroup

Wraps an Input with leading or trailing addons — icons, text labels, buttons, or dropdowns — without nesting extra form elements.

<Canvas of={InputGroupStories.Default} />

## InputOTP

A segmented input designed for one-time passwords and verification codes. Each character gets its own slot.

<Canvas of={InputOTPStories.Default} />

## Textarea

A multi-line text field for longer content like comments, descriptions, or messages.

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.Default} />

## Select

A fully custom styled dropdown built on Radix primitives. Use when you need consistent cross-browser styling and don't need search.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Default} />

## NativeSelect

A browser-native `<select>` element styled to match the design system. Use when you need maximum compatibility (mobile keyboards, screen readers) and don't need custom option rendering.

<Canvas of={NativeSelectStories.Default} />

## Combobox

An autocomplete input that filters a list of options as the user types. Supports both single and multi-select.

<Canvas of={ComboboxStories.Default} />

## Pattern: Field Integration

All input components integrate with **Field**, **FieldLabel**, **FieldDescription**, and **FieldError** for consistent form layouts with labels, help text, and validation messages.
