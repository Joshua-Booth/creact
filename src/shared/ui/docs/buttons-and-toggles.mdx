# Buttons & Toggles

Clickable controls for triggering actions or switching state. The key difference is whether the control is **stateful** (remembers on/off) or **stateless** (fires and forgets).

## Choosing a Component

| Component | Stateful? | Groupable? | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Button](?path=/docs/ui-button--docs) | No | Via ButtonGroup | Actions, form submission |
| [ButtonGroup](?path=/docs/ui-buttongroup--docs) | No | Is the group | Related button sets, split buttons |
| [Toggle](?path=/docs/ui-toggle--docs) | Yes (on/off) | Via ToggleGroup | Toolbar buttons (bold, italic) |
| [ToggleGroup](?path=/docs/ui-togglegroup--docs) | Yes (on/off) | Is the group | Exclusive or multi-select options |

## Button

A stateless control that fires an action when clicked. The most common interactive element.

## ButtonGroup

Groups related buttons into a single visual unit with connected borders. Use for split buttons, segmented controls, or sets of related actions.

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.Default} />

## Toggle

A two-state button that can be pressed (on) or unpressed (off). Use for toolbar-style controls like bold, italic, or alignment.

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.Default} />

## ToggleGroup

Groups multiple toggles into a single control where selection can be exclusive (single) or additive (multiple). Use for option sets like text alignment or view modes.

## Pattern: Button Variants

Button supports several variants for different emphasis levels:

- **default** — Primary actions (submit, confirm)
- **outline** — Secondary actions (cancel, dismiss)
- **secondary** — Less prominent actions that complement primary buttons
- **ghost** — Minimal actions in toolbars or tight spaces
- **destructive** — Dangerous actions (delete, remove)
- **link** — Tertiary actions styled as hyperlinks
