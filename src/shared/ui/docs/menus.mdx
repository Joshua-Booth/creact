# Menus

Menu components display lists of actions or links. The key distinction is **how they open** and **whether items are actions or links**.

## Choosing a Component

| Component | Trigger | Persistent? | Items are... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [DropdownMenu](?path=/docs/ui-dropdownmenu--docs) | Button click | No | Actions (callbacks) |
| [ContextMenu](?path=/docs/ui-contextmenu--docs) | Right-click | No | Actions (callbacks) |
| [Menubar](?path=/docs/ui-menubar--docs) | Click on bar | Bar always visible | Actions (callbacks) |
| [NavigationMenu](?path=/docs/ui-navigationmenu--docs) | Hover/click on bar | Bar always visible | Links (navigation) |

> **Key distinction:** DropdownMenu, ContextMenu, and Menubar share the same action-menu pattern — items fire callbacks. NavigationMenu is different: its items are links that navigate to other pages.

## DropdownMenu

A menu triggered by clicking a button. Use for action lists like "Edit", "Delete", "Share" attached to a specific element.

## ContextMenu

A menu triggered by right-clicking an area. Shares the same item API as DropdownMenu but opens on right-click instead of a button press.

<Canvas of={ContextMenuStories.Basic} />

## Menubar

A horizontal bar of menus, always visible at the top of a region. Each top-level item opens a dropdown of actions. Think of classic application menu bars (File, Edit, View).

## NavigationMenu

A horizontal bar of navigation links with optional dropdown panels for sub-navigation. Unlike the other menu components, items are `<a>` links, not action callbacks.
