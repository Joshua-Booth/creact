## About

<p style="padding-bottom: 20px">
creact is a React JS project template for quickly setting up advanced production web apps.
Setting up a complex app from scratch takes ages, so this template aims to have 
as many realistic project features and integrations as possible. However, with the focus on
being modular - you should be able to remove parts if they aren't a good fit for your project.

Take a look at the <a href="#features">features</a> to see what's included. And
if there's something that you think should be added, feel free to create a
[feature request](https://github.com/Joshua-Booth/creact/issues/new).

For more information about this project check out the [wiki].

## Usage

To use the application use the following commands:

### Production

Run `npm run build` to build the static files for production.

Run `npm start prod` to serve the production files.

:sparkles: Visit the site on the localhost URL.

### Development

Run `npm start dev` to start the webpack dev server for the web app.

:sparkles: Visit the site on the localhost URL.

### Testing

```sh
> npm t                # Unit tests

> npm start test.it    # Integration tests

> npm start test.e2e   # End-to-end tests

> npm start coverage   # Full test coverage report (unit, integration and e2e combined)
```

`npm t` starts the unit tests in watch mode, but you can also set the environment variable `CI`
to run the tests in continuous integration mode (this also works for integration and end-to-end tests).

### Other

Run `npm start help` for a full list of available commands.
