# For Vercel:
# - Most VITE_* variables should be set as Build Environment Variables in Vercel dashboard
# - Runtime variables (SENTRY_ORG, SENTRY_PROJECT, SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN) are only needed for sourcemap uploads
# - NODE_ENV is automatically set to production by Vercel

# For Netlify:
# - Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard under Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment
# - VITE_* variables need to be set as Build environment variables
# - Runtime variables should be set for production context

# Important:
# - VITE_* variables are embedded in client bundles at build time
# - Runtime variables (SENTRY_*, POSTHOG_HOST) are available on the server
# - Always use HTTPS URLs for production (except local development)
